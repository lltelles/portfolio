Projects -
The projects section is where I showcase my most notable works. Each project has its own dedicated folder with detailed documentation and source code, making it easy for you to delve into the specifics. Here are a few featured projects:

Fast and Furious: This game project is about a reinterpretation of the masterpiece “Fast and Furious”. Where Dom needs help to pass through enemies and find his friends. The player has to control Dom’s car by using the keyboard arrows to avoid all the enemies along the way. The game has 3 levels which increases speed every time the player passes a checkpoint. It also has two “friend’s bonus” each level that appears randomly among the enemies which gives the player 1 extra life or 5000 points. To accomplish the mission the player has 3 lives to survive.

Prícinpie+Real: During my final project at Ironhack Portugal, I had the amazing opportunity to collaborate with Príncipe+Real, an organization dedicated to promoting and enhancing the Principe Real neighborhood in Lisbon. The objective of the project was to improve their existing website and implement new features that would provide visitors with an enhanced experience of the neighborhood. They aimed to create a platform that would highlight local businesses, upcoming events, historical landmarks, and provide essential information about the area.
